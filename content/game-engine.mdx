As I start working more on the Red Empire game, I need to choose between Unreal Engine and Unity Engine. I decided to go with Unity Engine because I'm super experienced with it and have already developed really cool games with it. With that said, now, we need to talk about the different render pipelines that I can use to build most efficiently with the best looking game at the end.
I'm going to be going with the built in render pipeline because most of the assets I want to get from the Asset Store are only supported in the Built in render pipeline, making it the obvious choice. I didn't want to go with the Universal Render Pipeline because a lot of the assets I want to use aren't supported in the Universal Render Pipeline. I also didn't want to go out to the HDRP because it's way too expensive for what it's worth for my game.
