Over the last summer (Summer 2024), I participated in a business incubator called BETA Camp. After excelling at that program and then getting a scholarship to AlphaX, a more rigorous version of BETA Camp, I started working on this venture studio.
The first thing I'll need is to get the ShipFast tool to build not only my own landing page but work on other people's landing pages and apps. I'll post more in this blog post soon.
